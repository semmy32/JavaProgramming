Escape sequences: Must be given with double quote
    \n: starts a new line
    \t: horizontal tab: It gives a paragraph space to me, like tapping 3 time on tab button
    \\: prints backslash in java language. If I write at out of bracelets it means single line note,
    but in the bracelets area, it means backslash in console.
     \": in case of using double quote at console.
